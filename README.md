# hyperbolic_multilayer_MSA
This repository contains the PyTorch implementation for the paper “Microblog sentiment classification via a multilayer graph with social and semantic representations using hyperbolic learning”. Our work builds upon the Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network (HGCN) framework proposed by Chami et al. (Stanford, 2019).
